===============================================================================

GLM (multiple regression, analysis of variance) is a special case of SEM.

SEM allows us two types of flexibility:

1. Variables can simultaneously be causes and effects of other variables. You can model causal chains.
2. We can compute theoretic, non-observed latent variables, by measuring indicators of the latent variable. Method also takes into account of the imperfect nature of the measurement. We can draw conclusions about the latent variables.

Goal of the semester is learn the data analysis technique, develop ability to think critically about the technique.

Plan on 7.5 hours of work per week: 3 hours of homework for every hour in the class.

The first 11 weeks do not involve any inferences about means.
